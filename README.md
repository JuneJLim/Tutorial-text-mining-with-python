# Welcome to the Text Mining with Python Tutorial!

## Here are the steps you need to take before starting the tutorial:

1. Download Anaconda

If you do not have Anaconda on your computer, please download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (Scroll down to see the download links).

2. Download files for tutorial

Please download all the files you see [above](https://github.com/JuneJLim/UPenn-tutorial-text-mining-with-python) except for README.md in a folder on your computer.

3. Open a Jupyter Notebook

* Windows: Type "Jupyter Notebook" in the search box located on the task bar. A browser window should open up. In the browser window, go to the location of the Jupyter Notebook file you downloaded and open Text-Mining-With-Python-Tutorial-run-yourself.ipynb.

* Mac: Open a terminal. Type jupyter notebook. A browser should open up. In the browser window, go to the location of the Jupyter Notebook file you downloaded and open Text-Mining-With-Python-Tutorial-run-yourself.ipynb.

* If you are in a circumstance where you can't open a Jupyter Notebook, you can click [here](https://github.com/JuneJLim/UPenn-tutorial-text-mining-with-python/blob/main/Text-Mining-With-Python-Tutorial-read-through.ipynb) and just read the Jupyter Notebook that shows all the outputs. You cannot run the code yourself, but you can read it.
